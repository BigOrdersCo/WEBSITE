                                   <span>
                                        Christina grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, supporting her family’s Chinese restaurant since age 9. 
                                        She studied Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Business Management at MIT, and also interned at startups and 
                                        big companies alike each summer. Christina understands firsthand the struggles of small business owners, as well as the 
                                        resource abundance of large corporations and universities who want to support and care. Her hope for creating that bridge 
                                        between the two worlds sparked the idea of BigOrders. In her free time, Christina enjoys hiking, painting, and listening 
                                        to thought-provoking podcasts—all while exploring new places and cultures with her friends and family.

                                   <span>
                                        Selena was born and raised in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. Growing up, helping out at her parents' Chinese restaurant was a 
                                        big part of her life.

                                        She is currently a senior at Penn State earning a B.S. in Computer Science. She loves Penn State and enjoys doing technical 
                                        development for the student organizations she's in, including THON (a student-run philanthropy that raises funds to fight 
                                        childhood cancer) and HackPSU (Penn State's hackathon). 

                                        Selena has completed three software engineering internships with Fortune 500 companies during college. 
                                        In her free time, she lives her best life, spending time with the people she loves and going on runs (at a grandma pace).

                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                         Our BigOrders team consists of three co-founders: Christina Chen, Selena Liu, and Omari Nyarko. <br>
                         The idea for BigOrders manifested from Christina, as she pieced together experiences from her past and resources at her current disposal. 
                         She reached out to two friends, Selena and Omari, from those significant moments of her life to start an adventure. 
                         <br><br>
                         Selena and Christina grew up in the same town, both eldest daughters of immigrant parents who own a small Chinese restaurant. 
                         They understand firsthand the struggles of small restaurant owners as they were forced to comply with the 20-30% fees that online ordering services 
                         charge. Their parents work diligently, but without a strong education background, they can’t expand in this tech-forward age; we are their advocates. 
                         <br><br>
                         Omari and Christina interned at Amazon, both active members of their team who ordered weekly meals using the opulent funds of the big corporation. 
                         They felt frustrated with how tedious the food ordering process was. 
                         <br><br> 
                         Together, the three of us see an opening for our minds to create a product that’ll bridge the gaps of need and resources. 
                         We share a strong academic background and industry experience in computer science, while each carrying unique skills like 
                         project management, law, and mechanical engineering to complement and contrast with each other.
                         It’s our passion for technological innovation and supporting the operations and growth of small businesses that connects and strengthens our teamwork. 
                         We’re researching and applying our engineering learnings in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web development for a significant social cause. 
                         On the business and strategy front, we’re bringing our unique experiences in both the restaurant and customer perspectives to advocate for and serve our 
                         users. Food has the unique grounds of being a survival necessity with a playful spin, and we look forward to challenging ourselves to creatively 
                         connect technology and humanity at such a riveting time in history.
