We all ordered pasta, two with fettuccine and one with the zoodles. Beef ragu, Gamberi E Spinaci and the Pollo Rosso. Unfortunately, all three dishes were too salty and so we couldn’t eat them. It was really disappointing and I did mention it to staff. The staff member was going to tell the kitchen. I did see another review about salty food, so I hope Vapiano can fix the issue.",

We all ordered pasta, two with fettuccine and one with the zoodles. Beef ragu, Gamberi E Spinaci and the Pollo Rosso. Unfortunately, all three dishes were too salty and so we couldn’t eat them. It was really disappointing and I did mention it to staff. The staff member was going to tell the kitchen. I did see another review about salty food, so I hope Vapiano can fix the issue.",

We told the waiter we where sharing so they plated it on two plates amazing portion, the onion and the radicchio really balanced this dish out so well. The potato was so creamy delicate velvety Texture. I can not fault it. 10/10\nFor dessert we shared the pear and hazelnut nut cake. I could not taste the pear the Hazelnut was the star of it. It came which a chocolate sauce and some kind of thick cream.. it was like having a Ferrero rocher.\n\nWith the welcoming shervice and the style of Restaurant would be perfect for, date night, anniversary.

Our seat upstairs was beautifully appointed, and I love the basil and rosemary plants on each table. Your staff were excellent, courteous, and amazing photographers!

We ordered the truffle oil pizza and it was on point. I was also impressed with the service. The wait staff were attentive and really fast.
